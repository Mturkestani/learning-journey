Day 01 – Virtual Machines, Automation & Scripting Concepts
📘 Summary

Today I focused on understanding the basic concepts behind virtual machines, why automation is important in DevOps, and what scripting means. I learned these ideas on a theoretical level without using any tools yet.

🧠 What I Learned
1️⃣ Virtual Machines (VMs) – Concept

A virtual machine is a "computer inside a computer."

It allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical machine.

VMs provide:

Isolation

Safe testing environments

Flexibility for learning

They are widely used in servers, cloud platforms, and development environments.

2️⃣ Importance of Automation

Automation removes repetitive tasks that humans normally perform manually.

It reduces errors, saves time, and increases consistency.

In DevOps, automation is used for:

Deployments

Configuration

Testing

Server setup

The goal: make systems faster, more reliable, and less dependent on manual work.

3️⃣ Scripting – Concept

A script is a set of written instructions that a computer executes automatically.

Scripting helps automate simple or repetitive tasks.

Bash scripting is commonly used in Linux environments.

Even though I didn’t write or run a script today, I now understand that scripting is a foundation of automation in DevOps.
