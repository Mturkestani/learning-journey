Today, I continued my Linux learning journey and explored more powerful command-line tools and system concepts.

🔍 grep

Used to search for specific patterns inside files.

Very useful for filtering logs and text outputs.

Example:

Used to translate or transform characters in text.

Helpful for text processing and formatting.

Example:

echo "hello world" | tr a-z A-Z

✅ Key Takeaways

Linux provides powerful tools for text processing.

Understanding users and groups is critical for system administration.

Combining commands makes the terminal very powerful.

📌 Day by day, building a stronger foundation in Linux.
