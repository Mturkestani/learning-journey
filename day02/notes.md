📘 Summary

Today I learned the basic concept of Linux, practiced some simple Linux commands, and understood the difference between the terminal and the shell. This helped me understand how users interact with the operating system.

🧠 What I Learned
1️⃣ What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system.

It is widely used in servers, cloud environments, and DevOps tools.

Linux is stable, secure, and highly customizable.

Many cloud platforms and containers are built on Linux.

2️⃣ Basic Linux Commands

I learned some simple but important Linux commands:

ls → list files and directories

cd → change directory

pwd → show current directory path

mkdir → create a new directory

touch → create a file

cat → display file content

These commands are the foundation for working with Linux systems.

3️⃣ Terminal vs Shell

Terminal is the application where I type commands.

Shell is the program that reads, interprets, and executes those commands.

Bash is the most common shell used in Linux.

Flow:

User → Terminal → Shell → Linux Kernel

🔍 Key Takeaways

Linux is the backbone of servers and DevOps tools.

The terminal is just an interface, while the shell does the real work.

Learning basic commands is essential before automation.
